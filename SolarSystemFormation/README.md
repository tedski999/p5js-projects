# Solar-System-Formation
This p5.js program simulates how dust and particles might clump together and form rings and planets around a body in space. Basic gravity and collision effect all the particles which, over time, result in something akin to a solar system.

## Controls

* WASD - Pan camera around simulation.
* Mouse Click - Add particles to the simulation.
* N - Spawn particles randomly around the simulation.

*You can drag click to specify how much velocity you want the particle to have.*
