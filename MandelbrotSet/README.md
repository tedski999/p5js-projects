# Mandelbrot Set Simulation
A simulation of the Mandelbrot Set on a complex plane using the p5.js library.

## How To Use It

* WASD - Pan camera around simulation.
* Q + E - Control zoom level.

If the image is a bit small (and it probably is), simply zoom in with your browsers built-in zoom function. The image is quite blury, but there's only so much you can do with 250x250 pixels.
